# Armlab

Using a 6-DOF manipulator and depth camera to pick different sizes and colors of blocks and place them in the target locations. 

**Acting**: Homogeneous coordinate transforms / Forward kinematics / Inverse kinematics

**Sensing**: 3D image calibration / Object detection with OpenCV

**Reasoning**: Path planning / Path smoothing
